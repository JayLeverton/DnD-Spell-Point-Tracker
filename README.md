# DnD-Spell-Point-Tracker

Add, remove, and edit spells to a list of spells.
Adjust each spells cost, or leave it as the default for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons spell point conversion rate.
Hit the "Cast" button to deduct the spell's cost from the current spell points.
Hit the "Long Rest" button to set your current spell points to the current maximum.
Reset the entire list, save your spell points and spells, or load the previously saved configuration of spells with all of their names, costs, and levels.

Planned features:
- A spell log, that shows what spells you recently cast.
- A cleaner user experience, for mobile and desktop resolutions.
